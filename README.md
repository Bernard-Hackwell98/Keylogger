a basic keylogger coded in python that tracks all the keystrokes and paste the output in a file.

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a 15 line code about how to code a keylogger that cathes the keystrokes and puts it in a file. I coded this in Vscode but the code can work on any IDE. There is one caviate that the keylogger requires you to disable firewall, the firewall on Windows 10 can catch this.
